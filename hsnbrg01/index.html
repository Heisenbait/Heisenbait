        <h2>I Thought About Killing You</h2>
        <p>I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so...
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say: Don't say this, don't say that
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself, and I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum
Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need coconut rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits
Used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we obey
We was all born to die, nigga DOA
Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cape
Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah, I don't see no, mhm, mhm
If I wasn't shining so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay

Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go wayyy back
To when I had the braids and you had the waveee cap
Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't playyy that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got wayyy packed
They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay</p>
